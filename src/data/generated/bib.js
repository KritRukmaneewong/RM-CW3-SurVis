    "abstract": "The use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) has witnessed an outstanding rise as they aim to provide confidentiality and anonymity to communication. Despite this enormous and ubiquitous usage, VPNs come with 273 various security, misconfiguration, and performance related issues thereby hindering the users to take maximum advantage of this revolutionary technology. To address this concern, VPN users must choose the most secure and perfect VPN solution for the smooth functioning of daily life activities. Generally, no clear set of directions is available for assisting a common VPN user thereby accentuating the need to develop an elucidated and coherent checklist that thoroughly helps in evaluating any VPN based on its security, performance, auditing, and management function. This research comprehensively surveys VPN technologies, its features, working principles, and compliance principles that evolved over the last two decades. Based on it, this research presents a new methodology in the form of a feature-enriched template to comprehensively analyze a VPN solution. Each VPN feature is given its score against the potential damage it may cause in case of failure and the probability of occurrence of that failure. In this way, the corporate sector and individual users can quantitatively and qualitatively grade available options while choosing a VPN and use it effectively.",

    "abstract": "VPN is used for secure network transmission and require good performance support. When using VPN for large network construction, network topology composed of multiple servers becomes one of the important factors affecting network performance. This paper discusses the impact of performance with different VPN network topologies. The Softether protocol is used for building VPN. The performance of L2TP prototal is used as contrast to evaluate the VPN performance of different network topologies. Compared to the performance of the L2TP protocol, the number of layers of the tree topology does not exceed three layers. The conclusions of the paper can be referenced when we design a network topology and achieve ideal network performance.",

    "abstract": "In today's world, the security and privacy of data that travels through the cyberspace have become an essential concern for the individual users and the organizations. Apart from this, the government of many countries has also imposed many censorship rules on the way their citizens should use the Internet. All this has resulted in VPNs (Virtual Private Network) becoming very popular as it allows the users and organizations to secure and circumvent their Internet connection to a great extent. In this paper, we mainly study three types of most common VPNs and present a comparative study of their features, performance, security and a few other aspects. We hope that our research will offer a clear understanding of the users and will help them make their decision on choosing the correct VPN based on their need and priority regarding security, speed, and cost.",

    "abstract": "Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a widely used network layer security control for protecting communications. IPsec is a framework of open standards for ensuring private communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. IPsec configuration is usually performed using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol. This publication provides practical guidance to organizations on implementing security services based on IPsec so that they can mitigate the risks associated with transmitting sensitive information across networks. The document focuses on how IPsec provides network layer security services and how organizations can implement IPsec and IKE to provide security under different circumstances. It also describes alternatives to IPsec and discusses under what circumstances each alternative may be appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Through the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of clients using Virtual Private Network (VPN) has dramatically increased. Consequently, VPN vulnerabilities have become target points to be exploited by attackers. However, studies have been released to defend against such attacks with the purpose of securing VPN. Nevertheless, attacks with high sophistication still target VPNs to comprise the critical data being commu- nicated. VPN servers use protocols to secure connections with clients. However, these protocols are still targeted specifically with Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. This paper analyzes and treats the vulnerability of key negotiation process in the main mode as well as aggressive mode of Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol in IP Security (IPsec) VPN. We demonstrate experiments of a DoS attack based on Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol adjacent route spoofing. Thereafter, we propose a method to tackle those attacks through exploiting the Suricata as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in defending the VPN against DoS attacks.",

    "abstract": "The network security system is continuously advancing alongside technological developments. VPNs, which utilize open networks, aim to provide security by leveraging IPSec to transmit private data through L2TP tunneling strategy from the server to the branch computer/client and vice versa. Conversely, it can also lead to poor security practices. VPNs are implemented using the layer 2 IPSec tunneling protocol with two MikroTik devices. Testing is conducted to assess the security and speed of the network using the command line and MikroTik Winbox, where the server monitors packet delays to determine the improvement in network security quality. This research has identified several weaknesses in implementing this VPN protocol, namely the need for caution regarding the security of transmitted data to prevent misuse by the VPN provider.",

    "abstract": "Global Internet users increasingly rely on virtual private network (VPN) services to preserve their privacy, circumvent censorship, and access geo-filtered content. Due to their own lack of technical sophistication and the opaque nature of VPN clients, however, the vast majority of users have limited means to verify a given VPN service’s claims along any of these dimensions. We design an active measurement system to test various infrastructural and privacy as- pects of VPN services and evaluate 62 commercial providers. Our results suggest that while commercial VPN services seem, on the whole, less likely to intercept or tamper with user traffic than other, previously studied forms of traffic proxying, many VPNs do leak user traffic—perhaps inadvertently—through a variety of means. We also find that a non-trivial fraction of VPN providers transparently proxy traffic, and many misrepresent the physical location of their vantage points: 5–30% of the vantage points, associated with 10% of the providers we study, appear to be hosted on servers located in countries other than those advertised to users.",

    "abstract": "Internet users increasingly rely on commercial virtual private net- work (VPN) services to protect their security and privacy. The VPN services route the client’s traffic over an encrypted tunnel to a VPN gateway in the cloud. Thus, they hide the client’s real IP address from online services, and they also shield the user’s connections from perceived threats in the access networks. In this paper, we study the security of such commercial VPN services. The focus is on how the client applications set up VPN tunnels, and how the service providers instruct users to configure generic client soft- ware. We analyze common VPN protocols and implementations on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu. We find that the VPN clients have various configuration flaws, which an attacker can exploit to strip off traffic encryption or to bypass authentication of the VPN gateway. In some cases, the attacker can also steal the VPN user’s username and password. We suggest ways to mitigate each of the discovered vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "With the increase of remote working during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) around the world has nearly doubled. Therefore, measuring the traffic and security aspects of the VPN ecosystem is more important now than ever. VPN users rely on the security of VPN solutions, to protect private and corporate communication. Thus a good understanding of the security state of VPN servers is crucial. Moreover, properly detecting and characterizing VPN traffic remains challenging, since some VPN protocols use the same port number as web traffic and port-based traffic classification will not help. In this paper, we aim at detecting and characterizing VPN servers in the wild, which facilitates detecting the VPN traffic. To this end, we perform Internet-wide active measurements to find VPN servers in the wild, and analyze their cryptographic certificates, vulnerabilities, locations, and fingerprints. We find 9.8M VPN servers distributed around the world using OpenVPN, SSTP, PPTP, and IPsec, and analyze their vulnerability. We find SSTP to be the most vulnerable protocol with more than 90% of detected servers being vulnerable to TLS downgrade attacks. Out of all the servers that respond to our VPN probes, 2% also respond to HTTP probes and therefore are classified as Web servers. Finally, we use our list of VPN servers to identify VPN traffic in a large European ISP and observe that 2.6% of all traffic is related to these VPN servers.",
